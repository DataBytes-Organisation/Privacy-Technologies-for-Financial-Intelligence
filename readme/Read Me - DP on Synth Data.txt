mporting Libraries:

import pandas as pd: This line imports the pandas library, which is used for data manipulation and analysis. Pandas provides data structures like DataFrames for organizing and processing data.

import numpy as np: This line imports the numpy library, which provides efficient mathematical operations on arrays. NumPy is widely used for numerical computations.

import random: This line imports the random library, which provides functions for generating random numbers. Random numbers are used in this code to simulate transaction data.

Generating Customer Data:

customer_names = ["Alice", "Bob", ...]: This line creates a list of customer names.

account_numbers = [random.randint(10000000, 99999999) for _ in range(len(customer_names))]: This line generates a list of random account numbers for each customer. The random.randint() function generates an integer between 10000000 and 99999999.

transaction_dates = [pd.to_datetime(str(random.randint(2020, 2023)) + "-" + str(random.randint(1, 12)) + "-" + str(random.randint(1, 28))) for _ in range(len(customer_names))]: This line generates a list of random transaction dates for each customer. The str() function converts the random integers to strings, and the pd.to_datetime() function converts the strings to datetime objects.

deposit_amounts = [random.randint(100, 1000) for _ in range(len(customer_names))]: This line generates a list of random deposit amounts for each customer. The random.randint() function generates an integer between 100 and 1000.

Creating Synthetic Dataset:

synthetic_data = pd.DataFrame({...}): This line creates a Pandas DataFrame named synthetic_data using the generated customer data. Each column in the DataFrame corresponds to a piece of customer information.
Applying Differential Privacy (DP) to Deposit Amounts:

def add_noise(data, sigma): This function adds Gaussian noise with a standard deviation of sigma to the provided data. The noise is intended to protect the privacy of individual deposit amounts.

def compute_epsilon(sigma, delta): This function calculates the privacy parameter epsilon based on the standard deviation sigma and the privacy budget delta. Epsilon represents the privacy loss introduced by the noise addition.

sigma = 10: This line sets the standard deviation of the noise to 10.

delta = 0.01: This line sets the privacy budget to 0.01.

synthetic_data["Deposit Amount"] = add_noise(synthetic_data["Deposit Amount"], sigma): This line applies the add_noise() function to the Deposit Amount column of the synthetic_data DataFrame.

epsilon = compute_epsilon(sigma, delta): This line calculates the epsilon value based on the chosen noise parameters.

print("Epsilon:", epsilon): This line prints the calculated epsilon value, indicating the level of privacy protection.

Printing Synthetic Data with DP-Applied Deposit Amounts:

print(synthetic_data): This line prints the entire synthetic_data DataFrame, showing the customer information with the DP-applied deposit amounts.
