Homomorphic Encryption (HE) using Paillier Cryptosystem:

This code demonstrates the implementation of homomorphic encryption (HE) using the Paillier cryptosystem, which allows for performing operations on encrypted data without decrypting it first. This property makes HE particularly useful for privacy-preserving applications, such as secure multiparty computation and outsourced computation.

Importing the Paillier Library:

The code starts by importing the paillier library, which provides the necessary functions for performing Paillier encryption and decryption.

Encryption Function:

The encrypt() function takes a message and a public key as input and returns the corresponding ciphertext. The public key is a publicly known parameter that allows anyone to encrypt messages but only the owner of the corresponding private key can decrypt them.

The encryption process involves multiplying the message with a random number and then homomorphically adding the result to the public key. This randomization ensures that the ciphertext does not directly reveal the message.

Decryption Function:

The decrypt() function takes a ciphertext and a private key as input and returns the corresponding decrypted message. The private key is a secret key that is only known to the owner of the public key and is used to recover the original message from the ciphertext.

The decryption process involves performing the inverse of the encryption operation, which involves multiplying the ciphertext by the inverse of the random factor used during encryption.

Homomorphic Addition:

The homomorphic_addition() function takes two ciphertexts and a public key as input and returns the ciphertext corresponding to the sum of the original messages. This allows for performing addition on encrypted data without decrypting it first.

The homomorphic addition operation utilizes the homomorphic property of Paillier encryption, which states that the product of two ciphertexts is equivalent to the ciphertext of the sum of the corresponding plaintexts.

Homomorphic Multiplication:

The homomorphic_multiplication() function takes a ciphertext, a scalar, and a public key as input and returns the ciphertext corresponding to the product of the original message and the scalar. This allows for performing multiplication on encrypted data without decrypting it first.

The homomorphic multiplication operation utilizes the exponentiation property of Paillier encryption, which states that the ciphertext raised to a power is equivalent to the ciphertext of the product of the original message and the power.

Testing Homomorphic Operations:

The test_he_implementation() function demonstrates the use of the encryption, decryption, and homomorphic operations. It encrypts two messages, performs homomorphic addition and multiplication on the encrypted data, and then decrypts the result to verify the correctness of the operations.

The test confirms that the encrypted messages can be combined using the homomorphic properties of Paillier encryption without revealing the original messages.

Generating Public and Private Keys:

The code generates a pair of public and private keys using the paillier.generate_random_keypair() function. The public key is used for encryption, while the private key is used for decryption.
