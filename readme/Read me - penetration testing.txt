Penetration Testing Privacy-Preserving Techniques:

The provided code defines functions and test cases for evaluating the implementation of different privacy-preserving techniques, including Differential Privacy (DP), Homomorphic Encryption (HE), Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC), and Federated Learning (FL).

Differential Privacy (DP):

add_noise(data, sigma): This function adds Gaussian noise with a standard deviation of sigma to the provided data. The noise is intended to protect the privacy of individual data points.

compute_epsilon(sigma, delta): This function calculates the privacy parameter epsilon based on the standard deviation sigma and the privacy budget delta. Epsilon represents the privacy loss introduced by the noise addition.

test_dp_implementation(data, sigma, delta): This function tests the implementation of DP by adding noise to the data and calculating the epsilon value. It then analyzes the noisy data to ensure that privacy is preserved.

Homomorphic Encryption (HE):

encrypt(message, public_key): This function encrypts the provided message using the given public key. The public key is publicly available, while the private key is kept secret.

decrypt(ciphertext, private_key): This function decrypts the provided ciphertext using the given private key. The private key is required to recover the original message from the ciphertext.

test_he_implementation(message, public_key, private_key): This function tests the implementation of HE by encrypting a message and then decrypting it using the corresponding public and private keys. It evaluates the encryption and decryption process for correctness and security.

Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC):

share_secret(secret, num_parties): This function splits the provided secret into shares using Shamir's secret sharing scheme. The shares are distributed among multiple parties, and each party holds a unique share.

combine_shares(shares): This function combines the shares from multiple parties to reconstruct the original secret. All parties must participate in the reconstruction process.

test_smc_protocol(secret, num_parties): This function tests the implementation of SMC by sharing a secret among multiple parties and then combining the shares to reconstruct the secret. It verifies that the combined secret is equal to the original secret.

Federated Learning (FL):

aggregate_models(model_updates): This function aggregates the model updates from multiple clients into a single global model. The global model is updated based on the combined updates from all clients.

test_fl_implementation(training_data, model_architecture): This function tests the implementation of FL by simulating the FL training process with multiple clients. It then evaluates the aggregated model for potential backdoors or data leakage.

Each of these test cases aims to assess the effectiveness of the corresponding privacy-preserving technique in protecting sensitive data while maintaining functionality and accuracy.
