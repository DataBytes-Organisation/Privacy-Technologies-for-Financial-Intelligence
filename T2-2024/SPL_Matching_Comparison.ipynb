Privacy-preserving techniques such as Homomorphic Encryption (HE), Secure Multiparty Computation (SMPC), Differential Privacy (DP), and Hash-based Matching enable entities to collaborate securely on sensitive data without revealing the actual data. This experiment explores the effectiveness of these techniques in ensuring privacy and trust, particularly when public and private entities must collaborate.\n","As the demand for data privacy increases, particularly in contexts like national security, fraud prevention, and financial crime investigations, it's critical to strike a balance between data sharing and safeguarding individuals’ sensitive information.\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"YjkBg9wL_fDi"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### **Scenario (Use Case)**\n","**Suspicious Person List (SPL) Comparison**\n","\n","The use case involves comparing publicly held SPLs, which include various unique identifiers (passport numbers, driver licenses, or national IDs), with customer lists held by private entities. This process is crucial for identifying potential threats while ensuring the privacy of both private companies and individuals.\n","\n","**Privacy Considerations**\n","\n","•\tHigh Trust Situations: Data is encrypted in transit and at rest, with operations performed on secure systems.\n","\n","•\tMedium Trust Situations: Data is compared while encrypted, using privacy-preserving technologies, and governance arrangements are necessary between parties.\n","\n","•\tLow Trust Situations: Data is encrypted throughout the process, with results accessible only to the requesting public entity. Private parties do not learn the outcome unless further consent is obtained.\n","\n","**Use Case Example: Public to Private – Low Trust**\n","\n","In this scenario, public entities push SPL data to private entities for matching against their customer lists. The results are only accessible to the public party, ensuring that private entities do not gain any insights. This setup requires strong encryption methods, including homomorphic encryption and differential privacy, to maintain the confidentiality of data throughout the process.\n","\n","Technology Involved:\n","1.\tHomomorphic Encryption (HE): Enables encrypted data comparison without revealing underlying data.\n","2.\tSymmetric Encryption: Ensures results are securely shared after matching.\n","3.\tDifferential Privacy (DP): Adds noise to ensure no individual data point can be identified in the results.\n","4.\tSecure Multiparty Computation (SMPC): Allows multiple parties to jointly compute the result without revealing their inputs to each other.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"WVbtcGEsvgli"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### **Experimental Setup**\n","\n","**Data Generation**\n","\n","Synthetic data was generated to simulate the matching process between bank customers and suspicious persons:\n","\n","•\tBank Customers: 5,000 records, each with a unique TFN, name, date of birth, and address.\n","\n","•\tSuspicious Persons: 50 records, similarly structured, with a 10% overlap in TFNs to simulate realistic matching scenarios.\n","\n","**Privacy-Preserving Techniques**\n","1.\tHash Matching: TFNs are hashed and compared, simulating encryption.\n","2.\tHomomorphic Encryption (HE) Matching: TFNs are encrypted using HE, and matches are identified by comparing encrypted values.\n","3.\tSecure Multiparty Computation (SMPC) Matching: TFNs are secret-shared between parties, and matches are determined based on shared secrets.\n","4.\tDifferential Privacy (DP) Matching: Laplace noise is added to the match count to preserve privacy.\n","\n","**Performance Metrics**\n","\n","The performance of each method was measured based on:\n","\n","•\tNumber of Matches Identified: How many customer records matched with suspicious persons.\n","\n","•\tExecution Time: The time taken to perform the matching process.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Bbfj8NFKv2ni"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**1.
