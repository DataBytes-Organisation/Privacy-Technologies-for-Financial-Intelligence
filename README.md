# New-Discovery-Project
New Discovery Project - Privacy Technology for Financial Intelligence: Dive into the future of financial intelligence with our cutting-edge exploration of privacy technologies.

Welcome to the New discovery Project. The mission of the project is to research technologies that can enhance collaboration for financial intelligence. Our project relates to advancing research and knowledge in financial technologies to combat financial crime particularly Anti-Money Laundering (AML). This project is brand new and being run for the first time in trimester 3.

# Project Background
Complex financial crimes are frequently orchestrated by well organised and experienced criminal groups. 
These illicit activities often encompass multiple business entities and individuals, with financial activities 
spanning various countries, effectively concealing the illegal operations through layers of subterfuge. 
Money laundering is one of the most severe financial crimes, exacting an annual economic toll on Australia 
estimated at 10 âˆ’ 15 billion dollars.


# New Discovery Project Mission and Aim 
To assist with preventing and understanding financial crime through utilising financial technology. WAs part of this project we will aim to explore prominent privacy technologies commonly researched and implemented in the field of financial intelligence. Some of these technologies include, but are not limited to, the following:

- Secure multiparty computation (SMC or MPC): A protocol that allows multiple parties to work 
together to achieve the common goal, whilst keeping secure of the information that are not meant 
to be shared. For example, private set intersection (PSI) only releases the common entities between 
two data bases.
- Homomorphic encryption (HE): An advanced cryptographic technique that allows certain 
arithmetic operations (e.g., addition and multiplication) to be performed on encrypted data (i.e., 
ciphertext) without needing the secret key. A common scenario of HE is to encrypt the sensitive 
data then outsource the encryption to a third party with computational or analytical advantages.
- Differential privacy (DP): A statistical method to release data base query outcomes with calibrated 
noise to guarantee no individual information can be reverse engineered from the outcomes. For 
example, carefully calibrated noise is added to the average income of a group of people to stop 
individual income to be inferred, should another query is allowed to exclude a certain individual 
from the data base.
There are other popular privacy techniques that are often discussed and employed in financial intelligence, 
include hashing techniques, federated learning and so on

# Short Term End of T3 
By the end of the trimester we would like to write a report exploring prominent privacy technologies (being Secure multiparty computation (SMC or MPC) Homomorphic Encryption, Differential Privacy among others). 
- Initially we will look at a few common financial crime scenarios where intelligence sharing is inhibiting appropriate actions.
- Next the report will detail the technologies. It will describe what they are, how they work, pros and cons, current research on them. It will then discuss how they can assist with the scenarios. Finally it will outline further research areas
