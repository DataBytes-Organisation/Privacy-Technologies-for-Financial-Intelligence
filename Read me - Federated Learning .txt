Importing Libraries:

import tensorflow as tf: This line imports the tensorflow library, which is used for building and training machine learning models. TensorFlow provides a wide range of tools for deep learning applications.

import numpy as np: This line imports the numpy library, which is used for efficient numerical operations on arrays. NumPy provides a variety of functions for manipulating, analyzing, and transforming data.

Defining the Client Model:

def client_model(input_shape): This function defines the architecture of the local model that will be used on each client device. It takes the input shape of the data as an argument.

model = tf.keras.Sequential([...]: 
This line creates a sequential Keras model, which is a type of model where layers are stacked sequentially.

tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'): 
This line adds a dense layer with 64 neurons and a ReLU activation function to the model.

tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax'):
 This line adds another dense layer with 10 neurons and a softmax activation function to the model. The softmax activation function normalizes the output of the layer to a probability distribution.

model.compile(...): This line compiles the model, which involves configuring the optimizer, loss function, and metrics to be used during training.

return model: This line returns the compiled model.

Generating Synthetic Training Data:

num_clients = 10: This line sets the number of simulated clients. Each client will have its own local training data.

num_samples_per_client = 100: This line sets the number of training samples per client.

input_shape = (784,): This line sets the shape of the input data. For example, the MNIST dataset contains images of handwritten digits, each of which is represented by a 28x28 pixel image, resulting in a flattened array of 784 pixels.

train_data = [] and train_labels = []: 
These lines initialize empty lists to store the training data and labels, respectively.

for i in range(num_clients): This loop iterates over the number of clients.

X = np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=1, size=(num_samples_per_client, input_shape[0])): This line generates random training data for each client. The data is generated from a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The size parameter specifies the dimensions of the generated array.

y = np.random.randint(0, 10, size=num_samples_per_client): This line generates random labels for the training data. The labels are integers between 0 and 9.

train_data.append(X) and train_labels.append(y): 
These lines append the generated data and labels to the respective lists.

Initializing the Global Model:

global_model = client_model(input_shape): 
This line creates an instance of the global model, which is the model that will be updated during federated learning rounds.
Performing Federated Learning Rounds:

num_rounds = 10: This line sets the number of federated learning rounds. Each round involves training the local models on client data and then aggregating the updates into the global model.

for round in range(num_rounds): 
This loop iterates over the number of federated learning rounds.

local_updates = []: This line initializes an empty list to store the local model updates from each client.

for i in range(num_clients): 
This loop iterates over the number of clients.

X = train_data[i] and y = train_labels[i]: These lines extract the training data and labels for the current client.

local_model = client_model(input_shape): 
This line creates an instance of the local model for the current client.

local_model.fit(X, y, epochs=1, batch_size=32): 
This line trains the local model on the client's data for one epoch with a batch size of 32.
